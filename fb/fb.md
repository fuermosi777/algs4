Basic JavaScript async stuff (you should know event bubbling, debounce (its variant)... know how to code it). It would be a good idea to be aware of JS closure as well. 

Poll Widget question (just know your positioning, relative, static etc know the differences inside out). You might want to know specificity as well. 

If you were building a search tool and wanted search results to pop up as you typed but the server call was taxing, write a function that gets called on every key down but calls the server when the user stops typing for 400ms.

The most difficult question was the initial puzzle, which is a sizeable project. The phone interview was mainly focused on Javascript DOM tree manipulation. On-site questions included a few quick algorithms questions (flatten an array), design/code a poll widget. All of the questions were heavy on JS, which is expected for this position.

Write a function to compute the square root of a number without using any built-in functions.

Given 2 very large numbers, each of which is so large it can only be represented as an array of integers, write a function to multiply them.  

How many times would `addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);` run as the user looks at their News Feed? And what would be user experience if the `handleScroll` function takes 100ms to execute.

Related to question 1, how could you implement debouncing? Say you wanted the `handleScroll` function to be called only after 200ms has passed between scroll events. 

Write a function to display a JSON string in pretty format.
