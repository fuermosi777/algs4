Write HTML/CSS to duplicate the behavior of the profile image in a facebook profile. When mouse over, a "edit image" link should display in the corner, and hide on mouse out. 
Given a picture, how would you hide/show a child picture on hovering on this parent?  

How would you ensure clicking on this picture would go to a specific link?

How would you ensure the child is positioned in the top right of the parent picture? 

** Write a function that takes in a roman numeral string and returns its decimal value. You may assume input is a valid roman numeral.  

Write a function to flatten an array in JavaScript.  
Can you write a function that deeply flattens an array? 
Write an array flatten function. 
Flatten array. This array can have multiple types: {}, [], "", undefined, null, 123 are all valid types inside the array. 

If you have 500 revisions of a program, write a program that will find and return the FIRST bad revision given a isBad(revision i) function.  

Name a difficult challenge you faced while working on a project.  
Tell me a difficult problem you had to solve. 

difference between block and inline

Given a grid of characters output a decoded message. The message for the following would be IROCKA. (diagonally down right and diagonally up right if you can't go further .. you continue doing this)
I B C A L K A
D R F C A E A
G H O E L A D 

Basic JavaScript async stuff (you should know event bubbling, debounce (its variant)... know how to code it). It would be a good idea to be aware of JS closure as well. 

Poll Widget question (just know your positioning, relative, static etc know the differences inside out). You might want to know specificity as well. 

If you were building a search tool and wanted search results to pop up as you typed but the server call was taxing, write a function that gets called on every key down but calls the server when the user stops typing for 400ms.

The most difficult question was the initial puzzle, which is a sizeable project. The phone interview was mainly focused on Javascript DOM tree manipulation. On-site questions included a few quick algorithms questions (flatten an array), design/code a poll widget. All of the questions were heavy on JS, which is expected for this position.

Given a value N, return the corresponding string according to this pattern.
1
11
21
1211
111221
312211

Given an input array and another array that describes a new index for each element, mutate the input array so that each element ends up in their new index. Discuss the runtime of the algorithm and how you can be sure there won't be any infinite loops.  

Write a function to compute the square root of a number without using any built-in functions.

Given 2 very large numbers, each of which is so large it can only be represented as an array of integers, write a function to multiply them.  

How many times would `addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);` run as the user looks at their News Feed? And what would be user experience if the `handleScroll` function takes 100ms to execute.

Related to question 1, how could you implement debouncing? Say you wanted the `handleScroll` function to be called only after 200ms has passed between scroll events. 

Write a function to display a JSON string in pretty format.  

Using HTML and CSS, show how you would create an image that would display another image (aligned to the bottom, right) when the user hovers over the image.
