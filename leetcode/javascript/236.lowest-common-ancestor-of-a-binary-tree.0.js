 * Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given
 * nodes in the tree.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
 * is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v
 * and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of
 * itself).”

 * For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. Another
 * example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of
 * itself according to the LCA definition.
