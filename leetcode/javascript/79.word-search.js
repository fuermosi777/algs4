 * Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.
 * 
 * 
 * The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell,
 * where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The
 * same letter cell may not be used more than once.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * For example,
 * Given board = 
 * 
 * [
 * ⁠ ['A','B','C','E'],
 * ⁠ ['S','F','C','S'],
 * ⁠ ['A','D','E','E']
 * ]
 * 
 * 
 * word = "ABCCED", -> returns true,
 * word = "SEE", -> returns true,
 * word = "ABCB", -> returns false.
